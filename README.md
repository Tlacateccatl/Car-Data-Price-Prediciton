# **NYC-SAT-Analysis**

Car data prediction using ML , and deployment live on website.

## Context 
The aim of this project is to predict house prices using one basic machine learning algorithms such Linear Regression, and advanced algorithms like: Random Forest, ExtraTreesRegressor, Random Forest CV, and SVM, XGBOOST. We will also use regression and statistics tool in our analysis to understand the information with in the dataset. Then we deploy the model online.

## Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `NYC School Analysis.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory titanic_survival_exploration/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
jupyter notebook NYC School Analysis.ipynb
```

or
```
ipython notebook aNYC School Analysis.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

## Data
The datasets used in this project is included in the folder `schoolData`. This dataset is provided by [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io).
